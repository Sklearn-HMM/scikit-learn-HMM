.. note:: **Doctest Mode**

   The code-examples in the above tutorials are written in a
   *python-console* format. If you wish to easily execute these examples
   in **IPython**, use::

	%doctest_mode

   in the IPython-console. You can then simply copy and paste the examples
   directly into IPython without having to worry about removing the **>>>**
   manually.
