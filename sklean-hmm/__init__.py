"""
Machine learning module for Python
==================================

sklearn is a Python module integrating classical machine
learning algorithms in the tightly-knit world of scientific Python
packages (numpy, scipy, matplotlib).

It aims to provide simple and efficient solutions to learning problems
that are accessible to everybody and reusable in various contexts:
machine-learning as a versatile tool for science and engineering.

See http://scikit-learn.org for complete documentation.

the tests and will be removed in release 0.16.
