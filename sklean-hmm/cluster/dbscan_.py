    """Perform DBSCAN clustering from vector array or distance matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array [n_samples, n_samples] or [n_samples, n_features]
        Array of distances between samples, or a feature array.
        The array is treated as a feature array unless the metric is given as
        'precomputed'.

    eps: float, optional
        The maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered
        as in the same neighborhood.

    min_samples: int, optional
        The number of samples in a neighborhood for a point to be considered
        as a core point.

    metric: string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string or callable, it must be one of
        the options allowed by metrics.pairwise.calculate_distance for its
        metric parameter.
        If metric is "precomputed", X is assumed to be a distance matrix and
        must be square.

    algorithm: {'auto', 'ball_tree', 'kd_tree', 'brute'}, optional
        The algorithm to be used by the NearestNeighbors module
        to compute pointwise distances and find nearest neighbors.
        See NearestNeighbors module documentation for details.

    leaf_size: int, optional (default = 30)
        Leaf size passed to BallTree or cKDTree. This can affect the speed
        of the construction and query, as well as the memory required
        to store the tree. The optimal value depends
        on the nature of the problem.

    p: float, optional
        The power of the Minkowski metric to be used to calculate distance
        between points.

    random_state: numpy.RandomState, optional
        The generator used to initialize the centers. Defaults to numpy.random.

    Returns
    -------
    core_samples: array [n_core_samples]
        Indices of core samples.

    labels : array [n_samples]
        Cluster labels for each point.  Noisy samples are given the label -1.

    Notes
    -----
    See examples/cluster/plot_dbscan.py for an example.
